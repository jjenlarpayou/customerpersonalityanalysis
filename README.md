# 🧠 Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project applies data science techniques to analyze customer behavior and segment customers into distinct groups. The goal is to support marketing strategy development through data-driven insights.

## 📁 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Understand customer behavior using clustering, visualization, and predictive modeling.
- **Key Techniques**:
  - Data preprocessing & cleaning
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - K-Means clustering
  - PCA for dimensionality reduction
  - XGBoost classifier for cluster prediction
  - Yellowbrick for choosing k cluster

## 📊 Key Features

- Segmentation of customers based on income, tenure, and other behavioral features
- Visualizations of purchase behavior by age and income groups
- PCA-based scatter plot of customer clusters
- Business insights and strategy suggestions based on cluster interpretation

## 🔍 Dataset

The dataset was provided by **Dr. Omar Romero-Hernandez** and includes anonymized customer data such as:
- Demographics (age, education, income, marital status)
- Purchase behavior (web, catalog, store)
- Response to marketing campaigns

> 📌 Note: Some preprocessing was done to remove duplicates and handle missing values.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (KMeans, PCA, Evaluation)
- XGBoost

## 📈 Visual Insights

Key visualizations include:
- Age and income distribution
- Purchase source comparison by age and income
- Clustering results visualized with PCA
- Income vs. Tenure colored by cluster

## 🧠 Cluster Labels (Interpretation)

| Cluster | Label                     |
|---------|---------------------------|
| 0       | New Low-Income Customers  |
| 1       | Loyal High-Income Customers |
| 2       | New High-Income Customers |
| 3       | Loyal Low-Income Customers |
